## TxBuilder.buildPlaceholderWitnessSet() method

Builds a placeholder transaction witness set required for the transaction.

This includes collecting all necessary scripts (native, Plutus V1, V2, V3), redeemers, and Plutus data required for script validation.

Includes placeholder signatures for the known required signers, so we estimate the transaction size accurately

It organizes these components into a structured format that can be serialized and included in the transaction.

**Signature:**

```typescript
protected buildPlaceholderWitnessSet(): TransactionWitnessSet;
```
**Returns:**

TransactionWitnessSet

{<!-- -->TransactionWitnessSet<!-- -->} A constructed transaction witness set.

## Exceptions

{<!-- -->Error<!-- -->} If a required script cannot be resolved by its hash.

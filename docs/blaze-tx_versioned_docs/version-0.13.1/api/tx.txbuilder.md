<tbody><tr><td>

[addAdditionalSigners(amount)](./tx.txbuilder.addadditionalsigners.md)


</td><td>


</td><td>

The additional signers field is used to add additional signing counts for fee calculation. These will be included in the signing phase at a later stage. This is needed due to native scripts signees being non-deterministic.


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

[addDelegation(delegator, poolId, redeemer)](./tx.txbuilder.adddelegation.md)


</td><td>


</td><td>

Adds a certificate to delegate a staker to a pool


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

[addDeregisterStake(credential, redeemer)](./tx.txbuilder.addderegisterstake.md)


</td><td>


</td><td>

Adds a certificate to deregister a stake account.


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

[addInput(utxo, redeemer, unhashDatum)](./tx.txbuilder.addinput.md)


</td><td>


</td><td>

Adds an input to the transaction. This method is responsible for including a new input, which represents a reference to an unspent transaction output (UTxO) that will be consumed by the transaction. Optionally, a redeemer and an unhashed datum can be provided for script validation purposes.


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

[addMint(policy, assets, redeemer)](./tx.txbuilder.addmint.md)


</td><td>


</td><td>

Adds minting information to the transaction. This includes specifying the policy under which assets are minted, the assets to be minted, and an optional redeemer for Plutus scripts.


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

[addOutput(output)](./tx.txbuilder.addoutput.md)


</td><td>


</td><td>

Adds a transaction output to the current transaction body. This method also ensures that the minimum ada requirements are met for the output. After adding the output, it updates the transaction body's outputs. It also checks if the output value exceeds the maximum value size.


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

[addPreCompleteHook(hook)](./tx.txbuilder.addprecompletehook.md)


</td><td>


</td><td>

Adds a pre-complete hook to the transaction builder. This hook will be executed before the transaction is finalized.

Pre-complete hooks are useful for performing last-minute modifications or validations on the transaction before it's completed. Multiple hooks can be added, and they will be executed in the order they were added.


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

[addReferenceInput(utxo)](./tx.txbuilder.addreferenceinput.md)


</td><td>


</td><td>

Adds a reference input to the transaction. Reference inputs are used to refer to outputs from previous transactions without spending them, allowing scripts to read their data. This can be useful for various contract logic, such as checking the state of a datum without consuming the UTxO that holds it.


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

[addRegisterPool()](./tx.txbuilder.addregisterpool.md)

Adds unspent transaction outputs (UTxOs) to the set of UTxOs available for this transaction. These UTxOs can then be used for balancing the transaction, ensuring that inputs and outputs are equal.


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

[addWithdrawal(address, amount, redeemer)](./tx.txbuilder.addwithdrawal.md)


</td><td>


</td><td>

Adds a withdrawal to the transaction. This method allows for the withdrawal of funds from a staking reward account. Optionally, a redeemer can be provided for script validation purposes.

[complete({ useCoinSelection })](./tx.txbuilder.complete.md)


</td><td>


</td><td>

Completes the transaction by performing several key operations: - Verifies the presence of a change address. - Gathers inputs and performs coin selection if necessary. - Balances the change output. - Builds the transaction witness set. - Calculates the script data hash. - Estimates and sets the transaction fee. - Merges the fee value with the excess value and rebalances the change.

[delegate(poolId, redeemer)](./tx.txbuilder.delegate.md)


</td><td>

Adds unspent transaction outputs (UTxOs) to the set of collateral UTxOs available for this transaction. These UTxOs can then be used to provide collateral for the transaction, if necessary. If provided, they will b If there are specific, valid collateral UTxOs provided, Blaze will use them before using any other UTxO.


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

[provideDatum(datum)](./tx.txbuilder.providedatum.md)

<tr><td>

[provideScript(script)](./tx.txbuilder.providescript.md)


</td><td>

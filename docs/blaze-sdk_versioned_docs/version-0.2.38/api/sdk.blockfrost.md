[awaitTransactionConfirmation(txId, timeout)](./sdk.blockfrost.awaittransactionconfirmation.md)


</td><td>


</td><td>

This method awaits confirmation of the transaction given as argument. The response is parsed into a boolean, which is then returned. If tx is not confirmed at first and no value for timeout is provided, then false is returned. If tx is not confirmed at first and a value for timeout (in ms) is given, then subsequent checks will be performed at a 20 second interval until timeout is reached.


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

[evaluateTransaction(tx, additionalUtxos)](./sdk.blockfrost.evaluatetransaction.md)


</td><td>


</td><td>

This method evaluates how much execution units a transaction requires. Optionally, additional outputs can be provided. These are added to the evaluation without checking for their presence on-chain. This is useful when performing transaction chaining, where some outputs used as inputs to a transaction will have not yet been submitted to the network.


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

[getParameters()](./sdk.blockfrost.getparameters.md)


</td><td>


</td><td>

This method fetches the protocol parameters from the Blockfrost API. It constructs the query URL, sends a GET request with the appropriate headers, and processes the response. The response is parsed into a ProtocolParameters object, which is then returned. If the response is not in the expected format, an error is thrown.

[getUnspentOutputByNFT(nft)](./sdk.blockfrost.getunspentoutputbynft.md)


</td><td>


</td><td>

This method fetches the UTxO that holds a particular NFT given as argument. The response is parsed into a TransactionUnspentOutput type, which is then returned. If the response is not in the expected format, an error is thrown.


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

[getUnspentOutputs(address, filter)](./sdk.blockfrost.getunspentoutputs.md)


</td><td>


</td><td>

This method fetches the UTxOs under a given address. The response is parsed into a TransactionUnspentOutput\[\] type, which is then returned. If the response is not in the expected format, an error is thrown.


</td></tr>
<tr><td>

[getUnspentOutputsWithAsset(address, unit)](./sdk.blockfrost.getunspentoutputswithasset.md)


</td><td>


</td><td>

This method fetches the UTxOs under a given address that hold a particular asset. The response is parsed into a TransactionUnspentOutput\[\] type, which is then returned. If the response is not in the expected format, an error is thrown.

[resolveDatum(datumHash)](./sdk.blockfrost.resolvedatum.md)


</td><td>


</td><td>

This method returns the datum for the datum hash given as argument. The response is parsed into a PlutusData type, which is then returned. If the response is not in the expected format, an error is thrown.

This method resolves transaction outputs from a list of transaction inputs given as argument. The response is parsed into a TransactionUnspentOutput\[\] type, which is then returned. If the response is not in the expected format, an error is thrown.

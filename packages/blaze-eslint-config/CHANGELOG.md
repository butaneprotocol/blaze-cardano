## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- b2690c0: Adds serialization and parsing capabilities via a new @blaze-cardano/data package, and updates the @blaze-cardano/blueprint package with new code generation logic. In particular, generated code now supports recursively defined types! Note that this is a breaking change, and the library is still pre-1.0. Apologies for the necessity!
